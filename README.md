# Electric-circuit-with-5-servo-motors

# This Project Aim to Creat Electric circuit with 5 servo motors by using "Tinkercad", and allow Micro Servoes go from 0 to 90 degrees


# Tools:

* Arduino Uno R3.
* Micro Servo.
* Wires.
* Potentiometer.
* Breadboard.

 # Steps:

1- connect (5v) port on Arduino with the positive pin of the breadboard and ground  with negative section.

2- connect the positive section of the breadboard to the other positive side also in the negative so that current passes through all the breadboard.

3- connect all 5 Micro Servoes,each one have three wires: power(Green wire connected to positive pin),ground(Black connected to negative pin),signal(Yellow connected to a digital pin) to the breadboard.

4-Use Potentiometer to controls the Servomotors, each one have three wires: terminal1 (connected to positive pin), wiper(they can be connected in any pin of the numbers that start with the letter A pin),terminal2 (connected to negative pin).
